SILVER TSINAMI

1. BACKGROUND
Pewlett Hackard takes the pride of giving employment for many thousands of individuals over a long time period. However, in recent past the company has noticed a significant number of employees getting retired who had been there for many years. As this impact significantly on business day to day operation, the company now wants to understand 
»	How many employees would retire in the coming years and prepare retirement packages for those who meets certain criteria
»	Which positions need to be filled in near future

The company has requested an analysis report covering all the above aspects from the Human Resource Department to manage the retirement of employees effectively.


2. RESULTS

2.1 Employee Retirement Analysis

The analysis has taken the employees who have born between 01st January 1952 to 31st Dec 1955 and has 72,458 individuals that would retire in the coming years.  The major proportion out of the total identified employees that would retire come from Senior Engineering (36%) and Senior Staff (34%) (Refer graph Employee Retirement – Title Graph). Apart from the retirement, there will be staff turnover where employees may resign for personal reasons. Adding the staff turnover with retirement would be a major impact to the organization day to day operation efficiency as the employees that know the business and process leaves and the company needs to train new staff to perform.

2.2 Mentorship Program 
We assume that this program has been introduced to train the staff to take the roles of those who would retire in the coming years. For this programme we have taken only those who have been born in 1965 and the sample taken is not adequate compared to the organization size. And there could be young generation who are capable in taking responsibilities with qualifications and they would not stay long with the organization if they have not been identified, trained and recognized by the organization.

Deep downing the reports, it was questions the number of employees selected for mentoring is adequate to fill the retiring positions. For example there are 25,916 Senior Engineers would retire. However, for the mentoring progam been selected only 304 candidates. Also, the organization needs to look at the resource availability to run this program like human resources, time and other materials required (eg: Training staff, training materials and rooms if required)
  

3. SUMMARY

3.1 Employee
The organization performance consist depends mainly on highly skilled, experienced and cable staff. Therefore, the organization needs to balance the age diversity where the organization could balance the staff succession program effectively without impacting on the day to day business operation.

3.2 Mentorship Program
As the organization consist with large number of employees, it would be challenging to identify the right candidate and train them with in short term. But with proper retirement analysis the organization could have sufficient time to select and train them to take their next responsibility effectively.

 and there are many who are close to get retire. It is recommended that the management to have an analysis on retirement plan and its succession plan to identify the right candidate.
Highly capable and competitive staff is the most valued asset for an organization and not recognising them and rewarding them through progression plan (eg:mentoring programme) may lead them to resign and join another firm which gives a significant negative impact on the organization performance and competitiveness.
